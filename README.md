# Machine-Learning---final-project
Overview of Problem Statement:
The early prediction of diabetic patients’ readmissions within 30 days after hospital discharge is a crucial challenge in healthcare management. Identifying patients who are at high risk for early readmission can lead to proactive management, improved healthcare outcomes, and potentially lower healthcare costs. Given the complexity of patient profiles, medical history, hospital encounters, and test results, developing an effective predictive model is important for accurate forecasting.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge, using available clinical and hospital data. This model will support healthcare providers in taking timely interventions to reduce readmission rates and improve patient care.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that can predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days based on their clinical and hospital encounter data. The outcome will be a predictive tool to assist healthcare providers in managing at-risk patients by enabling early interventions.

3.Data Description:

The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008 dataset, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features: Patient Demographics:

Age: The patient's age at the time of admission.

Gender: The gender of the patient.

Race: The racial background of the patient.

Medical History and Visits:

Number of outpatient visits: Number of visits to the outpatient department before hospitalization.

Number of inpatient visits: Number of inpatient admissions before hospitalization.

Number of emergency visits: Number of emergency room visits before hospitalization.

Hospital Encounter Data:

Admission type: Type of admission (e.g., emergency, urgent, elective).

Time spent in the hospital: The number of days the patient spent in the hospital.

Number of lab tests: The number of lab tests performed during hospitalization.

Medications administered: The number and types of medications administered during hospitalization.

Test Results:

HbA1c levels: Lab test results related to the patient’s glycemic control.

Treatment Information:

Diabetic medications prescribed: Whether the patient was prescribed diabetic medication during the hospitalization.

Medical specialties of admitting physicians: The specialty of the physician who admitted the patient (e.g., endocrinology).

Target Column: Readmitted: Whether the patient was readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge (Yes/No).

Data Collection:
The data for this project can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains historical data from 130 US hospitals spanning from 1999 to 2008.
